            Boxing is not a sport, it's an art. It combines grueling physical
            training, intellectual work in strategy development, mental
            development and analysis of past situations. This sport is for
            everyone. Both professional athletes and beginners who want to put
            their body and spirit in order and be self-confident. However, do
            not forget that excessive sport leads to injuries and serious
            consequences for your health. Therefore, be balanced in the choice
            of loads and, if possible, use the services of trainers.
